**IMPORTANT**
If you are running on an Android OS version of Marshmallow or greater, go to settings and manually provide the GRAPE app permission to use Camera. Not doing so will crash the app. 



Known Bugs:<br>
- The app tends to crash sometimes when querying co-attendees information from the server
- The app does not request permission to use camera for scanning QR Code in Android OS Version Marshmallow and greater. It crashes if permission is not provided manually.
